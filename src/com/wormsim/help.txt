  -h         |

 --threads N + Sets the number of threads used to N. Allows a set number or
  -t N       | formula with the keyword MAX denoting the number of cores the
             | Java Virtual Machine has access to at runtime.
             | Note: On Intel processors with hyper-threading, performance gains
             |       may be seen by running with the physical core number
             |       rather than the number of virtual threads, which must be
             |       specified.

 --newrun N  + Sets the new run flag to N which must be a boolean value (either
  -n N       | true/t/1 or false/f/0, case insensitive).

 --timeout T + Runs for the specified time in milliseconds before stopping. This
             | may be used for scheduling processor time and will save a
             | checkpoint to resume at the end of the time period within
             | "{out.txt}".

 --dir D     + Defines the working directory of the program, that is the
  -d D       | location containing the input files and where the output files
             | will be stored. If there are spaces in the path, ensure the
             | string is enclosed in quotation marks (").
